# EV-System-using-blockchain
In electoral voting, the value can take the form of a vote. In this paper, we will show how
blockchain can be used to transfer votes between two peers. In our case, one peer is the voter
and the other is the candidate who receives the vote. We will explain how blockchain can be
employed in mass electoral voting procedures in a more secure way without needing a central
authority body. We will explain a voting system using blockchain that is more robust, tamperproof (immutable to voting changes either by the voter or by any other third parties) and costeffective. We have reviewed various blockchain technologies, i.e. Ethereum, Multichain,
available today to use in our voting system. Also, we will elaborate on the architecture, design
and design constraints and implementation implications of such a voting mechanism in our
society.
